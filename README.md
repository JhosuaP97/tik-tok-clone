# Tik-tok Clone

This project served as a great learning experience for me, as I was able to learn how to use [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio) for managing all content and perform operations more quickly and easily. I also utilized [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/), which allowed me to have a small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
